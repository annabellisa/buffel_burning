##### fastStructure

# Nov 2021

# see below for anaconda install instructions

# fastStructure stopped working via the direct route around Oct 2020. I had been using it successfully for years via that route and, despite a huge effort to get the pipeline working again, I could only get it to work through anaconda. 

# activate python2 VE
conda activate dictator

# cd to the software folder (bin) and paste the input files (bed, bim, fam) to the same directory:
cd /Users/annabelsmith/anaconda3/envs/dictator/bin

# working
python2 structure.py

# assign name:
infile="Cenchrus_filt2"
out_dir="Cenchrus_filt2_results"
out_prefix="Cenchrus_filt2"

echo $infile
echo $out_dir

# make out dir if it doesn't exist
# mkdir "$out_dir"

# 1-10 start (only takes a few mins on Cenchrus_filt2)

# Set max K and run analysis:
for i in {1..11} 
do

K_thisrun=$i

python2 structure.py -K $i --input=$infile --output=$out_prefix --format=bed --seed=100

done

# (it didn't put them in the outdir, but I'm not worried about this for now)

# remove allele frequency files:
rm *meanP

python2 chooseK.py --input=$out_prefix


# ----------------------------------
# anaconda install of faststructure

# installed command line: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#macos
# 64-Bit Command Line Installer (454 MB)
# read manual and accepted defaults
# installed in the awkward location: Users/annabelsmith/anaconda3
# need to close and re-open for it to work
# then conda should run from any location

# get list of installed packages
conda list 

# need to create a new environment for python2, following: https://towardsdatascience.com/environment-management-with-conda-python-2-3-b9961a8a5097

conda create -n dictator python=2.7 ipykernel

# To activate this environment, use
#
#     $ conda activate dictator
#
# To deactivate an active environment, use
#
#     $ conda deactivate

# then run these lines, which worked

conda activate dictator

conda install -c bioconda faststructure

# cd to the software folder (bin) and paste the input files to the same directory:
cd /Users/annabelsmith/anaconda3/envs/dictator/bin

# notes on install problems, 26 Oct 2020, moved to Offline_Results folder
# script and notes on non-anaconda run of fastStructure moved to offline results
