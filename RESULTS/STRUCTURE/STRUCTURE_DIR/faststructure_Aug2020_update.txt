# following fastStructure installation instructions: 

# the first step is to 'identify the path to the library files libgsl.so and libgslcblas.so, and header file gsl/gsl_sf_psi.h that are part of your GSL installation'

# however, these do not exist anywhere. Not in the /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include folders as suggested on the instructions, nor in the /usr/local/Cellar/gsl/2.6/lib, etc. folders where brew installs gsl

# to open the bashrc file
# a good explanation of the bash_profile on mac: https://scriptingosx.com/2017/04/about-bash_profile-and-bashrc-on-macos/
~/.bash_profile; open ~/.bash_profile

# so what happens if we add the lines anyway?

# do we add these lines:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib
export CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include"
export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib"

source ~/.bash_profile

ls /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages

# which resulted in this:

# Pip and setuptools have been installed. To update them
#  pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
# You can install Python packages with
#  pip install <package>
# They will install into the site-package directory

# See: https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-and-Python

pip install cython # worked! cython is in 2.7/site-packages
pip install scipy # installs numpy and scipy

# still, cannot find the libgsl.so files. 

# according to this post, fastStructure relies on an older version of gsl, in particular 1.6: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22222666/error-while-loading-shared-libraries-libgsl-so-0-cannot-open-shared-object-fil

# I have currently 2.6:
gsl-config --version
2.6

# downloaded 1.6 from here: ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gsl/

./configure # seemed to work
make # ran for a long time but had errors

# In file included from fp.c:34:
# ./fp-darwin.c:20:10: fatal error: 
#       'architecture/ppc/fp_regs.h' file not
#       found

# this post (https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gsl/2016-01/msg00008.html) suggests to uninstall the current version, so I did:

brew uninstall --ignore-dependencies gsl

# which worked:
# gsl-config --version
# zsh: command not found: gsl-config

# then deleted the previous folder and unzipped 1.6 again. Re-ran ./configure which seemed to work
./configure 

# make again, which led to the same fatal error:
make

# fatal error: 
#       'architecture/ppc/fp_regs.h' file not
#       found

# not run
sudo make install

# and we have .so files in gcc, but they are not the same files

# The following is me trying to get it working on the BigMac at Gatton:

# problem # 1 keep getting the error message "uqasmi57 is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported." when trying to update or install software

# I've done the changing ownership, but also need to do the make sure the user (uqasmi57) has write permission... didn't get that far

# this is what brew is telling me to do:

You should change the ownership and permissions of /usr/local/Cellar back to your
user account:

# this works
sudo chown -R $uqasmi57 /usr/local/Cellar

You should change the ownership of these directories to your user.

# these work but I had to do them individually:

sudo chown -R $uqasmi57 /usr/local/Cellar /usr/local/Frameworks /usr/local/Homebrew /usr/local/bin /usr/local/etc /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d /usr/local/include /usr/local/lib /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig /usr/local/opt /usr/local/sbin /usr/local/share /usr/local/share/aclocal /usr/local/share/doc /usr/local/share/info /usr/local/share/man /usr/local/share/man/man1 /usr/local/share/man/man3 /usr/local/share/man/man5 /usr/local/share/man/man7 /usr/local/share/zsh /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions /usr/local/var/homebrew/linked /usr/local/var/homebrew/locks

And make sure that your user has write permission.
  chmod u+w /usr/local/Cellar /usr/local/Frameworks /usr/local/Homebrew /usr/local/bin /usr/local/etc /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d /usr/local/include /usr/local/lib /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig /usr/local/opt /usr/local/sbin /usr/local/share /usr/local/share/aclocal /usr/local/share/doc /usr/local/share/info /usr/local/share/man /usr/local/share/man/man1 /usr/local/share/man/man3 /usr/local/share/man/man5 /usr/local/share/man/man7 /usr/local/share/zsh /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions /usr/local/var/homebrew/linked /usr/local/var/homebrew/locks
